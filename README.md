This is an Expo based React Native project. To run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can then hit i/a on the terminal to start the iOS or Android simulator. If you are on a Mac it is best to open a Simulator first then try this. The first time you do this it will install the Expo app on the simulated device.
